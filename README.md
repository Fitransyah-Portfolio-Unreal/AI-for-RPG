Which perception update run inside the AI controller itself that loop every 0.5 seconds using sight perception config.  
This AI fit for RPG enemies that will come and attack when sighting attack target.  
For teleporting using Unreal EQS (Environment Query System) that will run some test and using that test result to execute task in Behaviour Tree.  
In this case teleporting away from player once player near to enemies.
